An example of injecting custom code into a particular Cocoa application.
This injection infects Safari.app. Then you can use Objective-C method
swizzling and class-dump to see what to patch.
SIMBL (http://www.culater.net/software/SIMBL/SIMBL.php) uses the same
method of injecting based on custom Apple script.
